## Forecasting Power Consumption in Tetouan city located in Morocco


This project is a part of the ADS-506 course in the Applied Data Science Program at the University of San Diego.

-- Project Status:Active


# Project Objective
The main purpose of this project is to create a time-series forecasting model that can effectively predict the daily power consumption of distribution networks in Tetouan city based on the features in the dataset. Furthermore, we aim to identify any time series patterns including seasonality, level, trend, and noise to appropriately predict such forecasting values.

 On a larger scale, using time series data and machine learning efforts can help power supply companies improve their efficiency and performance.

Project Description: 
The dataset is a csv file titled "Tetouan City power consumption" obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset is a time series data that contains 10-minute power consumption data from January 1st, 2017 to December 30th, 2017. There are a total of 52,417 obersvations and 9 variables in the dataset with no null values. The dataset variables include: temperature, humidity, wind speed, general diffuse flow, and diffuse flow. The dataset was explored on a 10-minute, daily and monthly interval to observe any trends and seasoanlity. Utlimately, the daily interval was deemed best for modeling and forecasting methods. Modeling and forecasting methods include the following: 
•	Average
•	Naive
•	Seasonal Naive
•	Holt's Winter
•	TSLM
•	Auto Arima
•	Arima
•	Neural Network
•	Random Forest
